# Gemini 1.5 Flash API with Kaggle

## Overview  
This repository contains a Kaggle Notebook demonstrating the use of Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API for text generation and image analysis. The project highlights creative text generation (e.g., humorous descriptions) and analysis of a chessboard image, marking a first step into AI-driven applications.

## Features  
- **Text Generation:** Generates engaging narratives such as chess-themed jokes or stories using Gemini 1.5 Flash.  
- **Image Analysis:** Provides descriptive and creative analysis of a chessboard image.  
- **Kaggle Integration:** Uses Kaggle Secrets for secure API key management and smooth notebook execution.

## Setup  
1. Open the notebook in Kaggle and enable internet access.  
2. Add your Gemini API key as a Kaggle Secret named `KEY`.  
3. Dependencies (`google-generativeai`, `PIL`, `IPython`) are pre-installed on Kaggle.  
4. Use the provided chessboard image URL or upload your own via Kaggle’s Data input.

## Usage  
- Run the notebook cells to generate text, e.g., "Tell a funny chess joke."  
- Analyze the chessboard image using prompts like "Describe this image humorously."  
- Modify prompts to experiment with different text generation and image analysis tasks.

## Future Improvements  
- Extend support for analyzing multiple images or datasets.  
- Integrate additional Gemini API features, such as chat or code generation.  
- Add interactive visualizations for chess strategies.

## Acknowledgments  
- Built with Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash API.  
- Hosted on Kaggle for seamless execution.
