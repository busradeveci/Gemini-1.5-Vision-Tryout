## Overview  
This repository contains a Kaggle Notebook demonstrating the use of Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API for text generation and image analysis. The project focuses on generating creative text (e.g., humorous descriptions) and analyzing a chessboard image, marking a first exploration into AI-driven applications.

## Features  
- **Text Generation:** Produces engaging narratives, such as chess-themed stories or jokes, using Gemini 1.5 Flash.  
- **Image Analysis:** Analyzes a chessboard image with creative and descriptive outputs.  
- **Kaggle Integration:** Leverages Kaggle Secrets for secure API key management and seamless execution.

## Setup  
- **Kaggle Notebook:** Open the notebook in Kaggle and ensure internet access is enabled.  
- **API Key:** Add your Gemini API key as a Kaggle Secret named `KEY`.  
- **Dependencies:** Requires `google-generativeai`, `PIL`, and `IPython` (pre-installed in Kaggle).  
- **Image:** Use the provided chessboard image URL or upload your own via Kaggle's Data input.

## Usage  
Run the notebook cells to:  
- Generate text (e.g., "Tell a funny chess joke").  
- Analyze a chessboard image with prompts like "Describe this image humorously."

Modify prompts to experiment with different text or image analyses.

## Future Improvements  
- Expand to analyze multiple images or datasets.  
- Integrate additional Gemini API features, such as chat or code generation.  
- Enhance with interactive visualizations for chess strategies.
